## PyBank

In the PyBank part, I was able to retrieve the total number of months and the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period based on what we learned in the classes. And I applied "float" to the net total amount in case there are any decimal numbers in the column "Profit/Losses". However, I had trouble setting up the initial value for calculating the changes over the period. I searched for hints using the Xpert Lerning Assistant, but eventually found help on how to set the inital value from the resource listed below. Additionally, I used the ChatGPT and learned the way to retrieve the maximum/minimum numbers and the index of a specift element in a list. After getting all the results I need, I successfully printed the results to terminal and exported them to a text file.

## PyPoll

After completing the PyBank part, I was more familiar about how to manipulate data in a CSV file using Python. Therefore, it was easier for me to complete this part. However, I encountered a trouble when I first tested my code to print the "candidatelist" list and noticed that the data in the "election_data.csv" file wasn't sorted by the candidate's name. So I consulted ChatGPT and learned a way to sort the data in a CSV file. In this part, I organized the original data in the order that I needed and exported the result to a new CSV file. And then I was able to retrieve all the results I needed by using the new sorted CSV file.
